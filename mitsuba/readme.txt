Mitsuba Blender Addon
---------------------

Authors: Wenzel Jakob, Bartosz Styperek, Francesc Juh√©

This directory contains the addon for Mitsuba Renderer <-> Blender
integration. It is based on the excellent LuxBlend 2.5 code from
Luxrender project.

Mitsuba Blender exporter tries to convert Blender all scene information
to Mitsuba Renderer format. Custom properties panels are added to
Blender UI to set Mitsuba Renderer options and custom attributes.



Installation
------------

Copy this folder to Blender addons folder and then enable Mitsuba
addon on 'Addons > Render' section of Blender 'User Preferences' panel.
After enabling the addon, configure the 'Executable Path' setting in
'Mitsuba Engine Settings' render panel by selecting the folder where
Mitsuba Renderer binary is installed. Blender might have to be restarted
after configuring 'Exectuable Path' for Material preview to work.
